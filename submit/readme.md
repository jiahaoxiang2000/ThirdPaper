# submit

here we first want to submit is the _IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Part II: Express Briefs_.

## TCAS-II

### Material preparation

> For all TCAS-II manuscript submissions the page length must be a strict _4.5_ pages for Content and _0.5_ page for References (_total 5_ pages), i.e., the last half page (preferably a FULL last half page) of the manuscript must be reserved only for References. This is a formatting and page length requirement, and this rule applies to all submissions. The manuscripts that do not follow this format will be returned to the authors to be reformatted to the specified formatting requirement

### Submission to TCAS-II

**Journal:** IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs (TCAS-II)

- **Submission date:** Thu, May 8, 2025, 05:34:03 PM CST
- **Decision:** Rejected on Wed, May 14, 2025, 08:35:48 AM HKT

> **Reason for rejection:**  
> Unfortunately, this paper does not fit well within the scope of the journal. The scientific content related to the circuits & system field is very limited. As it is, it seems more suitable for the Computer community.

**Submission rationale:**  
We identified a similar paper published in TCAS-II:  
[Efficient implementation of AES-CTR and AES-ECB on GPUs with applications for high-speed FrodoKEM and exhaustive key search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9749135) on 2022.  
However, the editor indicated that our paper does not align with the journal's scope, so we need to seek another journal for submission.
