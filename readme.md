# Third paper

The third paper is after the [Efficient Implementations of CRAFT Cipher For Internet of Things](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/FirstPaper) and [Low-Latency Implementation of Bitsliced SPN-Cipher on IoT Processors](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/SecondPaper). The First paper is hardware implement, the second paper is software implement, and the third paper is the combination of hardware and software implement.

## background survey

consider the combination particular difficulties, if all the design hardware and software by beginning, those will speed too much time.
So we can use the existing heterogeneous hardware to accelerate the software implementation of the cipher. Maybe greater way.

We want to use the GPU unit to accelerate the software implementation of the cipher. The GPU unit is a heterogeneous hardware, and it is very suitable for parallel computing. The GPU unit can accelerate the software implementation of the cipher.

more detail can see the [background folder](./background/)
