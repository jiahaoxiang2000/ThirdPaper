    "- Lamport's one-time signatures [15] → extended by Merkle [17] for many-time use.\n",
    "- Relies on simple hash function properties; Merkle’s method originally required a fixed number of signatures and was stateful.\n",
    "- Over time, performance and theoretical underpinnings improved, leading to XMSS [7,8] (still stateful).\n",
    "- SPHINCS [5] introduced a stateless hash-based signature (larger keys/signatures vs. XMSS).\n",
    "- SPHINCS+ further refines SPHINCS. It uses **hypertrees** and few-time signature (FTS) schemes to authenticate many key pairs.\n"
