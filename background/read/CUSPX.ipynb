    "# CUSPX: Efficient GPU Implementations of Post-Quantum Signature SPHINCS+\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "- We introduce CUSPX (CUDA SPHINCS+), the first large-scale **parallel implementation** of SPHINCS+ capable of running across 10,000 cores.\n",
    "  - CUSPX leverages a novel three-level parallelism framework, applying it to _algorithmic parallelism_, _data parallelism_, and _hybrid parallelism_.\n",
    "  - CUSPX introduces parallel Merkle tree construction algorithms for arbitrary parallel scales and several load-balancing solutions, further enhancing performance.\n",
    "- CUSPX achieves a single task’s signature generation latency of **0.67 ms**, demonstrating a 5,105× speedup over a single-thread version and an 18.50× speedup over the previous fastest implementation.\n"

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected three DSAs for standardization : CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+.\n",
    "Also, a KEM is selected for standardization: CRYSTALS-KYBER. According to the NIST’s recent presentation, the standardization of these algorithms is expected to be finalized in 2024.\n",
    "Compared to the other three lattice-based algorithms, SPHINCS+ can offer more conservative security but with poorer performance. Therefore, it is necessary to optimizes the performance of $SPHINCS+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **SPHINCS+** is the PQC stander until 2025.\n"

    "### 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The reported maximum throughput of SPHINCS+-128s-simple is 80.65 signatures per second on an FPGA implementation, corresponding to 12.40 ms per signature and 14,285.71 verifications per second, or 0.07 ms per verification.\n",

    "### 1.2 Challenges and Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our design faces three challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large-scale parallel designs: Efficiently parallelizing $SPHINCS+$ on GPUs, with their many cores and poor single-core performance, is a challenging task.\n",
    "- Hybrid parallel designs: Hybrid parallelism requires a trade-off between latency and throughput, which further complicates the design of parallel schemes.\n",
    "- GPU efficient implementation: It is a challenge to make $SPHINCS+$ fully utilizes the hardware resources on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "> the challenges not close related to the $SPHINCS+$ algorithm itself. It is the all parallel computing challenges.\n"

    "- We propose CUSPX (CUDA SPHINCS+), the first large-scale parallel implementation for standardized general-purpose HBS. Three parallel schemes are designed for various application scenarios: algorithmic parallelism, data parallelism, and hybrid parallelism. Our code will be open-sourced after the article is accepted.\n",
    "- We present a three-level parallel framework: multi-tree, inter-node, and intra-node levels, which can be used individually or in combination. Merkle tree parallel construction algorithms for arbitrary parallel scales are proposed.\n",
    "- We design a general-purpose hybrid parallel scheme for HBS. CUSPX understands task parallelism as a higher-level existence than the three-level parallel framework, that is, hybrid parallelism of CUSPX is a _four-level parallel framework_. Moreover, we design four kinds of load-balancing schemes for $WOTS+$ and two for $FORS$ trees.\n"
