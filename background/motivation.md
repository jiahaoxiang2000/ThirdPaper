# Motivation

For more popular projects, here we want to do the Post-Quantum Cryptography [PQC](https://csrc.nist.gov/pqc-standardization) project, which specify algorithms derived from CRYSTALS-Dilithium, CRYSTALS-KYBER and SPHINCS+, were published August 13, 2024.

Here we want to optimize the SPHINCS+ scheme, which is not digital signature algorithm, like the SHA-256. SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme, which is a post-quantum secure digital signature algorithm. Here is the [3rd round submission package](https://sphincs.org/data/sphincs+-round3-submission-nist.zip) for the NIST PQC project.
