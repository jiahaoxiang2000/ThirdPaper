\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\IEEEPARstart{Q}{uantum} computers pose a significant threat to current cryptographic systems through their ability to efficiently solve mathematical problems that underpin modern security protocols. This threat materializes in the anticipated ``Q-Day", when quantum computers attain sufficient computational power to compromise public encryption systems safeguarding digital communications, authentication mechanisms, and key exchange protocols. Widely deployed public-key cryptosystems such as RSA and ECC are particularly vulnerable to Shor's algorithm \cite{Shor1994}, which can efficiently factor large integers and compute discrete logarithms—problems considered computationally infeasible using classical computing approaches. In response to these vulnerabilities, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization process to develop cryptographic schemes resistant to quantum computing capabilities \cite{NIST2016}. The imminent threat of encrypted data being harvested now for future decryption once quantum computing matures makes the transition to post-quantum cryptography increasingly urgent for protecting sensitive information and maintaining long-term data security.

SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}, a prominent stateless hash-based signature scheme and NIST standardization finalist \cite{Turan}, provides robust quantum-attack resistance through secure cryptographic hash functions \cite{Bernstein2019}. This scheme subsequently formed the foundation for the Stateless Hash-based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA), now standardized as FIPS 205 \cite{FIPS205}. The computational intensity of these hash-based signatures has necessitated research into efficient implementations across various hardware platforms, including CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs \cite{Joseph2022}, to facilitate organizational transitions to post-quantum cryptographic solutions.

\subsection{Related Work}

GPU acceleration for SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} has evolved substantially in recent years. Lee and Hwang~\cite{Lee2022} established the fundamental parallel implementation techniques for hash-based signatures, demonstrating the viability of GPU acceleration for post-quantum cryptography. Building on this foundation, Kim et al.~\cite{Kim2024} developed parallel methods for critical SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+} components—specifically FORS, WOTS\textsuperscript{+}, and Merkle tree computations. Their implementation on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 achieved significant throughput improvements, despite efficiency constraints from multiple kernel invocations.

Subsequently, Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2025} introduced CUSPX, a sophisticated three-level parallelism framework integrating algorithmic, data, and hybrid parallelization approaches. Their implementation featured optimized parallel Merkle tree construction algorithms and strategic load-balancing techniques, resulting in substantial performance enhancements.

\subsection{Motivation}

Existing GPU implementations of SLH-DSA reveals two fundamental efficiency constraints.
First, conventional approaches apply uniform thread allocation across all cryptographic operations, neglecting the distinct computational characteristics of individual functions. This static resource allocation creates significant imbalances certain operations suffer from excessive synchronization overhead while others underutilize available computational resources.

Second, the hierarchical structure of SLH-DSA, comprising multiple hash operations distributed across FORS, WOTS\textsuperscript{+}, and Merkle tree components, permits decomposition into smaller computational units. However, current implementations emphasize maximizing thread count rather than optimizing computational efficiency, resulting in suboptimal per-thread performance despite high hardware utilization rates.
These limitations necessitate an adaptive parallelization approach that dynamically determines optimal thread configurations for specific cryptographic functions while enabling fine-grained decomposition of signature components.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper presents a thread-adaptive GPU-based implementation of SLH-DSA with the following key contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A dynamic thread allocation methodology that optimizes thread configurations for individual cryptographic functions based on their computational characteristics, effectively balancing parallelism with execution efficiency to minimize synchronization overhead while maximizing throughput.

  \item A sophisticated function-level parallelization approach that strategically decomposes cryptographic operations into independent computational tasks, significantly reducing latency and enhancing the performance of core SLH-DSA primitives.

  \item Performance evaluation on NVIDIA GPU architecture demonstrating a throughput of XXX SLH-DSA signatures per second, representing substantial improvement over state-of-the-art implementations.
  The complete implementation is available as an open-source repository at \url{https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/sphincs-plus}.
\end{enumerate}

The paper is structured as follows: Section~\ref{sec:preliminaries} presents the fundamental concepts of the SLH-DSA signature scheme; Section~\ref{sec:implementation} describes the architectural design and implementation details; Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} analyzes performance results and comparative metrics; and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarizes findings and discusses future research directions.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

\subsection{SLH-DSA Overview}

SLH-DSA is a stateless hash-based signature scheme that delivers post-quantum security through a hierarchical certification structure. The signature generation process relies on three main components:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{WOTS+ (Winternitz One-Time Signature)}: A one-time scheme that handles authentication paths and underpins the Merkle tree construction
  \item \textbf{FORS (Forest Of Random Subsets)}: A few-time signature scheme that uses $k$ components, each containing $t$ elements selected from pseudorandom subsets
  \item \textbf{Hypertree}: A multi-layer structure of height $h$ divided into $d$ layers, each containing Merkle trees of height $h/d$ for authenticating WOTS+ public keys
\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:sphincs-process}
\end{figure}

The SLH-DSA signature generation process, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sphincs-process}, employs a hierarchical authentication structure. A message digest is first created via hashing, followed by signing with the FORS few-time scheme, producing $k$ authentication paths of $t$ elements each. The resulting FORS public key is authenticated through a hypertree of $d$ layers, where each layer uses WOTS+ to sign the root of the layer below. This chain of signatures leads to the final root node, offering efficient verification with robust hash-based security.

Two operational modes, “simple” and “robust,” are provided to balance speed and security. Parameter sets facilitate trade-offs among signature size, security level, and computational efficiency. All security properties derive from the hash functions, rendering SLH-DSA resistant to quantum attacks.

\subsection{GPU Computing Model}

Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) incorporate a large number of cores organized within multiple Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs). This highly parallel structure supports Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) execution, wherein threads are grouped into warps, and warps collectively form blocks. Each block is then scheduled across available SMs, ensuring that thousands of concurrent threads can execute similar instructions in parallel.

In the CUDA framework, memory optimization strategies such as coalesced accesses, shared memory buffering, and constant memory utilization further enhance throughput. Extensive parallelization of SLH-DSA computations is therefore facilitated, allowing performance improvements through a combination of thread-level, data-level, and algorithmic parallelism.

\section{Optimized Implementation of SLH-DSA}\label{sec:implementation}

% TODO: here we think need use the one figure to show the all optimization architecture, and then use the subfigure to show the details of each part.
% use the tikzpicture to create the figure


The optimization framework employs a dual-component architecture as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:optimization_architecture}. This framework integrates Adaptive Thread Allocation (ATA) with Function-Level Parallelism (FLP) to maximize computational efficiency while maintaining cryptographic integrity.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{./fig/optimize-overview.drawio.pdf}
  \caption{SLH-DSA optimization architecture showing the hierarchical parallelization model. The kernel function $g$ undergoes thread-level parallelization where individual function instances $g_{(\cdot,\cdot)_i}$ are distributed across $t$ dynamically allocated threads based on workload characteristics and available system resources.}
  \label{fig:optimization_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Adaptive Thread Allocation}

Traditional GPU implementations of cryptographic algorithms often apply maximum thread allocation universally, overlooking the unique computational profiles of individual operations within SLH-DSA. This research presents a thread-adaptive methodology that precisely calibrates parallelization based on function-specific characteristics to achieve optimal performance.

\subsubsection{Performance Modeling}

The execution time for each cryptographic function $g_i$ in SLH-DSA is characterized by Eq.~(\ref{eq:execution_time_model}):

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:execution_time_model}
  T(g_i, t) = \alpha_i + \frac{\beta_i}{t} + \gamma_i \cdot t
\end{equation}

This model captures three essential components: $\alpha_i$ represents invariant computational overhead, $\frac{\beta_i}{t}$ reflects the parallelizable workload component that scales inversely with thread count, and $\gamma_i \cdot t$ quantifies thread management overhead that increases linearly with thread allocation. This formulation encapsulates the fundamental parallelization tradeoff between computational acceleration and synchronization costs.

\subsubsection{Optimal Thread Determination}

By minimizing $T(g_i, t)$ with respect to $t$, the optimal thread allocation $t_i^*$ for each function is derived as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:optimal_thread_count}
  t_i^* = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_i}{\gamma_i}}
\end{equation}

The parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, and $\gamma_i$ were determined through rigorous profiling of each cryptographic operation across multiple thread configurations, establishing an empirical basis for optimization decisions.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Implementation}

The thread allocation optimization is implemented according to Algorithm~\ref{alg:adaptive_thread_allocation}.

% here maybe can writing more thing.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Adaptive Thread Allocation (ATA)}
  \label{alg:adaptive_thread_allocation}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE Set of cryptographic functions $G = \{g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_m\}$
    \ENSURE Optimized thread configuration for each function

    \FOR{each function $g_i \in G$}
    \STATE Profile $g_i$ with varying thread counts $t \in \{2^j | j \in [5, 10]\}$
    \STATE Fit performance data to model $T(g_i, t) = \alpha_i + \frac{\beta_i}{t} + \gamma_i \cdot t$
    \STATE Calculate $t_i^* = \sqrt{\frac{\beta_i}{\gamma_i}}$
    \STATE Round $t_i^*$ to nearest power of 2 for GPU scheduler compatibility
    \ENDFOR

    \STATE Store thread configuration in constant memory lookup table
    \RETURN Thread configuration table
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This architecture dynamically balances parallelism against synchronization overhead, yielding precise resource allocation tailored to each cryptographic operation. The thread configuration is maintained in GPU constant memory for negligible-latency access during execution, ensuring computational efficiency without introducing additional runtime overhead.

\subsection{Function-Level Parallelization}

The implementation introduces fine-grained parallelization at the hash function level, departing from conventional approaches that treat hash functions as atomic operations. This technique reduces cryptographic operation latency by decomposing hash operations into parallel tasks distributed across multiple threads.

\subsubsection{Internal State Parallelism}

% NOTE: here use the concise figure to show the internal state parallelism more great.

The approach decomposes hash function operations into concurrent tasks that can be executed in parallel by multiple threads within a single warp. For SHA256, the internal state transformations are parallelized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{State Initialization}: Multiple threads concurrently initialize different portions of the hash function's state array. Thread 0 handles initial state setup, while threads 0-15 cooperatively load message words in parallel, reducing initialization overhead.

  \item \textbf{Round Functions}: Each round of the SHA256 permutation is decomposed into lane operations executed concurrently by different threads. Threads 0-15 process message schedule expansion, while threads 0-7 manage state variable updates during round computation.

  \item \textbf{Data Sharing}: Warp-level primitives  \texttt{\_\_shfl\_sync()} enable efficient data sharing without requiring expensive shared memory operations. These synchronized operations allow threads within a warp to exchange data with minimal divergence, enhancing computational efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Task Distribution }

A hierarchical task allocation scheme is implemented to efficiently distribute hash function operations across GPU threads:

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Hash-Function-Level Task Distribution}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \REQUIRE Hash function $H$, Input data $M$, Number of threads $T$
    \ENSURE Hash output

    \STATE Partition internal state of $H$ into $T$ segments
    \STATE Assign each segment to a thread
    \FORALL{rounds $r$ in hash function}
    \STATE Each thread processes its assigned state segment
    \STATE Synchronize threads using warp-level primitives
    \STATE Perform cross-thread state mixing through register shuffling
    \STATE Synchronize threads
    \ENDFOR
    \STATE Combine results from all threads using reduction operations
    \RETURN Final hash output
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The task distribution strategy is optimized for SHA256 operations within SPHINCS\textsuperscript{+}, where hash function calls account for over 90\% of computational workload. The implementation employs a tiered approach where:

\begin{itemize}
  \item At the intra-warp level, 16 threads collaborate on a single hash computation with specific state variable assignments
  \item At the block level, multiple warps process independent hash operations concurrently
  \item At the grid level, optimal workload distribution is maintained with 128 blocks of 256 threads per block
\end{itemize}

For WOTS+ chain computations, which constitute approximately 70\% of the signature generation workload, this task distribution achieves a 5.3x speedup compared to conventional single-thread-per-hash implementations.
